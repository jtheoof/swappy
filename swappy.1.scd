# NAME

swappy - grab and edit on the fly snapshots of a Wayland compositor

# DESCRIPTION

*swappy* [options...]

# SYNOPSIS

swappy is a command-line utility to take and edit screenshots of Wayland
desktops. Works great with grim, slurp and sway. But can easily work with
other screen copy tools that can output a final PNG image to *stdout*.

swappy will save the annotated images to the config *save_dir*, see below.

If absent, then if it will try to default to a *Desktop* folder following this
pattern: *$XDG\_DESKTOP\_DIR*. If this variable is not set, it will revert to:
*$XDG\_CONFIG\_HOME/Desktop*. If *$XDG\_CONFIG\_HOME* is not set, it will revert
to: *$HOME/Desktop*.

# OPTIONS

*-h, --help*
	Show help message and quit.

*-v, --version*
	Show version and quit.

*-f, --file* <file>
	A PNG file to load for editing.

	If set to *-*, read the file from standard input instead. This is grim
	friendly.

*-o, --output-file <file>*
	Print the final surface to *<file>* when exiting the application.
	
	If set to *-*, prints the final surface to *stdout*.

	Note that the *Save* button will save the image to the config *save_dir*
	parameter, as described in the SYNOPSIS section.

# CONFIG FILE

The config file is located at *$XDG\_CONFIG\_HOME/swappy/config* or at
*$HOME/.config/swappy/config*. The file follows the GLib *conf* format.

	show_panel=false
